# Manga-Web-App
I create a website to read manga using MangaDexApi ( still in progress ) which I can sign in and tracking my read.

### What I have done 
- Login and Singup connect with MySQL database
- Responsive design
- Navigation bar with image and imageUrl

### What I look for 
- Manga App using MangaDex API
- A tracking tab of some User's Skill in **"/profile"**
- Other extra extension to make this is comfortable for me ^-^
